## Description
The "Embedded Real Time Control Project" GitHub repository hosts the coursework project for the "Embedded Real Time Control" course. In this project, participants, including Edoardo Scarpel, Simone Furlan, Stelina Mukaj, and Maedeh Ebrahimi, work on coding a robot (Rover) designed and constructed by Ing. Riccardo Antonello. The Rover is equipped with an STM32F767 microcontroller, based on the ARM Cortex-M7 architecture. The main objective of the project is to develop real-time control systems tailored for embedded environments. Participants engage in programming tasks to control the Rover and collect relevant data throughout the series of laboratories.

## Directory Structure
